WHY: Purpose of this library is to enable me to write a fully functionaly app in hours and days instead of weeks and months.
     The other purpose is to help me write code fast at work. I will use the same standards and naming conventions to make sure it is compatible with them. I should not change anything here. I will only change in the code when I am making it for my startup. 
HOW: I will write all the components myself. I will create a library of my own. I will have bare minimum of all things.
     My library will not have a purpose of library that gives others ability to use and create with it. But it will only enable me to write code. I will have a component of table which will take data in certain way and does it own thing.
     What is the biggest benefit is that I will be able to use it as a library but I will have all the customisation required.
     I will have all the access without the fat. If I don't need anything I will not have it in my code. I would customise as I please.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
